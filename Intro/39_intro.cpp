//Arangement in the main memory is data structure. 
//Database means arranging the data in some model like say a relational model in the permannt storage, so that it can be retrieved or to acccessed by applications. 
//That arangement is called as database. 
// Historical data can be kept in array of disk. This is data warehouse. It is helpful for business that previous data, large size. The algorithm written for that data are data mining algorithms. 

// Again, Data Strucutr is in main memory, during the execution of a program, arrangement of data in the main memory. 
// Arrangement of data on the disk is Database. 
// Later on, we assme that we have 64 KB of main memory. 
// 64 KB means 64 * 1024 = 65536 bytes
// segement is 64 KB 


//What is static memory
// How many bytes of memory is required by this function was decided at compile time. 
// So what is static. The size of the memomory is static. When it was decide by the compiler. 

// If there are sequence function claa, how memoty allocated inside stack?
