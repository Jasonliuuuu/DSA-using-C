//There are two physical data Structure. 
// One is array and the other is linked list
// Why it is described as physical?
// These data structue deicdes or defines how the memory is organized, how the memory is organized and allocated. 
// Thw size of array is static. You can not change after initilize it. 
// Where the array can be created? An array can be created either inside stack or it can be created in heap. We can have a pointer to a array. When you are sure the maximum , you can go for array. 
// Linked list is a complete dynamic data structure. And it is a collection of nodes, which each node contains data and link to next node. The length of the list can grow and reduce, dynamically. So it is having variable lengh. The linked list is ALWAYS created in heap. [[[[ALWAYS in HEAP]]]]]
// These two are physical because thet define how the moemory should be organized for storing the elements or data. 

//--------------------Logical DS---------------------------------
// List of Logical data structure:
// 1. Stack (LIFO)
// 2. Quenes (FIFO)
// 3. Trees  
// 4. Graph
// 5. Hash Table
// The question is thart how you want to utilize those values? How you will be performing insertion and deletion. What is the discipline you are going to follow? The discipline is difined by these data structue. (Logical DS!!!!!) This is the DISCIPLINE
// Number 1 and 2 (Stack and Quene) is linear Data structure. And 3 and 4 is non-linear Data structure. And the last one, Hash Table, may be linear or Tabular data structure. 

//For implementing these Data structure, we wither use array or linked list. That is to say, these logical data structure are implemented using any of these physical data structure. Or the combination of array and linked list.
